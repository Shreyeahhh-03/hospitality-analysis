# Atliq Hotels Revenue Optimization Project

Welcome to our data analytics consulting project focused on **revenue leakage detection and optimization strategies** for Atliq Hotels. This project analyzes booking behavior, cancellation patterns, pricing inefficiencies, and underperforming services across major cities to deliver actionable, data-driven solutions for boosting profitability.

## Project Objective

To identify root causes of revenue leakage across hotel properties in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderababd and Bangalore, and develop targeted recommendations through:

- Smart pricing strategies (weekday vs. weekend, seasonal, OTA-specific)
- Room-type and city-wise performance evaluation
- KPI tracking (RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, Cancellation Rates)
- Operational and service optimization opportunities
- ROI-backed recommendations with forecasting models
